## Did you finish the challenge?

1. **Create a new repository** and upload the project to Github with public access (be careful with your API KEY or other sensitive information).
    * The api key is not going to be at the repository but it's going to be asked once the app is lunched, you can pass either your own api key which
    will work correctly or I would pass the one I created for this project.
1. Send us an email with the link to the repository and the answer to the following questions:

    * How long did you spend on this?
        * I spent 1.5 days to get it done, I did try as much as I could, I tried following all the directions required. 
    * Did you complete your implementation?
        * Yes, I did it partially. 
    * What would you have added if you had more time?
        * I wish I could have more time to invest Testing, transitions scrolling down for generate request with pagination, maybe exploring something in security.
    * What was the most difficult part of the app?
      unit testing and pagination
    * What was your favorite part of the app?
        playing with modules and presentation, also the way to manage the api key
    * Is there anything else youâ€™d like to add?
       each time that i add a new movie to favorites update it in real time, i hate wait to relaunch the app
